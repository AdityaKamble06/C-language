******************************Loop Control Instruction**************************
Why loops?
Sometimes we want our programs to execute a few sets of instructions over and over again, for eg. Printing 1 to 100, first 100 even numbers, etc.

Hence loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer that a given set of instructions must be executed repeatedly.

Types of Loops: Primarily, there are three types of loop in c language:

1.While loop

2.do-while loop

3.for loop

We will look into this one by one

***While Loop***
While(condition is true) 
{
// Code                                         // The block keeps executing as long as the condition is true
// Code
}

An example:
int i=0;
while (i<10)
{
printf(“The value of i is %d”,i); i++;
}

***Note:***

If the condition never becomes false, the while loop keeps getting executed. Such a loop is known as an infinite loop.

Quick Quiz: Write a program to print natural numbers from 10 to 20 when the initial loop counter i is initialized to 0.

The loop counter need not be int, it can be a float as well.

***Increment and decrement operators***
i++  (i is increased by 1)

i--  (i is decreased by 1)

printf(“—i=%d”,--i);

This first decrements i and then prints it

printf(“i--=%d”,i--);

/*This first prints i and then decrements it

>>> +++ operators does not exists => Important
>>> += is compound assignment operator just like -=, *=, /= & %= =>Also important

***Do-while loop:***
The syntax of do-while loop looks like this:
do 
{
//code;
//code;
}while(condition)

Do-while loop works very similar to while loop
While -> checks the condition & then executes the code
Do-while -> executes the code & then checks the condition
**do-while loop = while loop which executes at least once

***For Loop***
The syntax of for loop looks like this:

for( initialize; test; increment or decrement)
{
//code;
//code;
}

Initialize -> setting a lop counter to an initial value
Test -> checking a condition
Increment -> updating the loop counter

An example:
     for(i=0;i<3;i++)
    {
        printf(“%d”,i);
        printf(“\n”);
    }

Output:
0
1
2
