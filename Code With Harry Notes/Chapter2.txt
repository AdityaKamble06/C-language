*************************** Instructions and Operators **************************

A C-program is a set of instructions. Just like a recipe - which contains instructions to prepare a particular dish.

Types of instructions:
1.Type declaration instruction

2. Arithmetic instruction

3.Control instruction

Type of declaration instruction:

int a;
float b;

other variations:

int i = 10; int j = i, int a = 2;
int j1 = a + j - i;

float b = a+3; float a = 1.1;       ==>Error! As we are trying to use a before defining it. 

int a,b,c,d;

a=b=c=d=30;                         ==> Value of a,b,c & d will be 30 each.
